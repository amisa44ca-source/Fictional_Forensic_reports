# Fictional_Forensic_reports
This folder contains fictional forensic case studies I have created. Each report includes:

- Detailed external and internal examination of the decedent
- Toxicology analysis and scene observations
- Summaries and discussion of cause and manner of death

All reports are **educational and creative works**; any resemblance to real persons or events is purely coincidental.
