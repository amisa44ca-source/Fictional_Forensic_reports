# Mock_Forensic_reports
This folder contains fictional forensic case studies I have created. Each report includes:

- Detailed external and internal examination of the decedent
- Toxicology analysis and scene observations
- Summaries and discussion of cause and manner of death

All reports are **educational and creative works**; any resemblance to real persons or events is purely coincidental.
AUTHOR’S NOTE: All the mock autopsy reports are based on a fictional case scenario generated using AI, as I do not have access to real forensic cases. The analysis, biological reasoning, and report structure were developed independently by me. This piece reflects my interest in forensic pathology and my effort to understand mechanisms of death through structured, scientific writing. Certain details have been simplified for clarity and may not fully reflect real-world forensic procedures.
